ðŸš€ Automating Instagram Image Uploads with Java + Selenium! ðŸ“¸

I built a fully automated solution that logs into Instagram, navigates UI elements, handles popups, and uploads a photo, all using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and EdgeDriver.

Features:
âœ… Secure login with credential checks
âœ… Dynamic XPath handling for evolving Instagram UI
âœ… Cookie banner & popup management
âœ… File upload automation
âœ… Screenshot capture at each step for traceability
âœ… Robust error handling and fallback strategies

Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Java for core logic
ðŸ”¹ Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
ðŸ”¹ Edge WebDriver for browser control
ðŸ”¹ Explicit Waits to handle dynamic elements
ðŸ”¹ Screenshot capturing for debugging & tracking each step

This project taught me the value of adaptive automation, XPath troubleshooting, and ensuring resilient scripts for real-world UIs that change often.
